<p><img src="images/t.gif" width="25" height="45" alt="T" align="left">he plans for Victory City have evolved over a period of 38 years, nurtured by the vision and dedication of Victory City's inventor, Orville Simpson II. Mr. Simpson conceived of the general idea of Victory City in 1936, when he was only 13 years old. Afraid of being ridiculed, Mr. Simpson kept his ideas about designing and building the City of the Future to himself &#133; a secret vision he held in his mind for approximately 24 years.</p>

<p>It wasn't until 1960 &#151; after he had embarked on a lucrative career in real estate investing and apartment building management &#151; that Mr. Simpson decided to make his ideas about Victory City known to the general public. Though not formally trained in graphic design or architecture, Mr. Simpson began sketching the entire Victory City model, building by building, with painstaking detail and vibrant color.</p>

<p>To complement his drawings, Mr. Simpson eventually wrote a short manuscript describing how the Victory City community would be run &#151; everything from the food system to shops and hotels to schools and health care.</p>

<p>It's been 62 years since the Victory City muse first whispered in Mr. Simpson's ear. Amazingly, at 75 years old, his enthusiasm for the project has done nothing but grow, and he continues to tweak and perfect his Victory City plans on a regular basis. Mr. Simpson is in the process of setting up the Victory City Corporation, a group of investors who will hopefully turn Victory City into reality some day.</p>
