<H1>Is This City of Future?</H1>
<p><small>By Stan Sulkes, <I>Cincinnati Post</I>, October 27, 1998</small></p>

<p>"My first name means 'city of gold,'" explains Orville Simpson the Second. And no parents could have been more prescient
than his unless, perhaps, they had named him "city of reason."</p>

<p>For true to his name, Simpson, 75, has spent the last 38 years consumed with his vision of a radically new city &#151; one based on reason and efficiency.</p>

<p>He calls it Victory City because "it represents the victory of rationality."</p>

<p>It is unlikely that the world is ready for a rational city, but should it ever come to its senses, Simpson is ready.</p>

<p>His Hyde Park apartment, in fact, is hostage to his sustaining vision: Tables are heaped with blueprints, scale models, maps,
artist renderings and everything else necessary to make Victory City a reality.</p>

<p>Simpson &#151; the subject of a Life Magazine feature in 1987 &#151; has already invested $100,000 of his own money in the project.</p>

<p>"Cities are obsolete," he says.</p>

<p>In his conception, all of Dayton, Ohio, with its 182,000 inhabitants and 217 square miles could be encompassed in a compact
Victory City measuring only 3 square miles.</p>

<p>A typical city would contain seven linked buildings &#151; each 102 stories &#151; which would house not only residences, but light
industry, offices and shopping. Apartments would be rented, rather than owned. Indestructible, they could be renovated in 10
minutes.</p>

<p>Floors would be fashioned of poured concrete; walls would be snap-out modular ones; and furniture would be bolted to the
floor.</p>

<p>Kitchens would be banned. "They're fire hazards and inefficient," he says.</p>

<p>Instead, residents would eat in huge cafeterias &#151; an idea prompted by Simpson's Army days &#151; but his plan adds a novel twist: Diners would be transported by Ferris wheels.</p>

<p>Dining would become educational, with films about the evolution of man projected onto the walls.</p>

<p>Since efforts to raise money for this Utopian scheme have failed, Simpson has recently gone online with his project.</p>

<p>His Web site has potential to reach a global audience of investors; moreover, he says it may prove educational for architects and city planners.</p>

<p>It also allows Simpson to display his project without having to carry around 5-and-a-half-foot scale models.</p>
