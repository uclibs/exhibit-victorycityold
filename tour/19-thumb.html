<p>Each of the Small Residential Buildings would house 12,500 people, compared to the Large Residential Building, which would house 25,000 people. The attached Splinter Elevator Building would serve as a shortcut to the parking lot, bypassing the Main Elevator Building. It would also be used as an alternate escape route in case of fire.</p>
