<p>Freight and passenger elevators service the Industry Buildings on each side. Industry Buildings would stand 20 stories tall and would accommodate thousands of employees of various businesses that would rent space from Victory City Corporation. Ramps leading from the Main Elevator lobbies would lead back directly to the cafeterias, where the employees could easily get their lunch each day. This would save all the businesses the cost and trouble of establishing company-owned cafeterias.</p>
