<p>Every day, fresh produce, fish and chicken would be brought to the kitchens from the greenhouses, fish farm and poultry center. This would eliminate the need for canning, freezing, preservatives, artificial flavors, and all the other "junk" currently used in food production. All food would be cooked and eaten the same day it is brought in.</p>
<p>Also eliminated would be the need for food processing plants, food storage warehouses, and food trucking and delivery cross-country. In addition, grocery stores would become a thing of the past, as well as most kitchen equipment and food storage in residential apartments.</p>
