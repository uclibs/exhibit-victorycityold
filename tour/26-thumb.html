<p>To accommodate traveling executives and businesspeople, luxury apartments, penthouses, and hotel suites would be built into the top floors of the Small Residential Building, north of the Main Elevator Building. These luxury accommodations would also be available to any Victory City resident who desired plusher living quarters than would be available in the other Residential Buildings.</p>
<p><I>Illustration by Orville Simpson II. Due to a recent major change and improvement in the plans, some of the buildings in the older drawings are mislabeled as "Commercial" rather than "Residential." This is one example.</I></p>
