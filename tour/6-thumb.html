<p>The Main Elevator Building would be divided into 9 sections. The upper 8 sections would be served by elevators, which would travel "express" to their particular sky-lobbies, carrying up to 50 people each. When people get off at their sky lobby, they would get on standard-sized elevators, which would take them express to their particular floor. The platforms seen in the picture would hold 50 people. When the elevator door opens, one platform carrying 50 people who want to go up would roll into the elevator, while at the same time, another platform carrying 50 people who just came down would roll out the door on the opposite side.</p>
