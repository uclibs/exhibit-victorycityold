<H1>Introduction</H1>

<H3><font color="#004685"><font color="#004685">A Unique Opportunity for a Better Life</font></font></H3>

<p>This is the ideal age for the rugged individualist.  Victory City will open up new opportunities that never existed before, offering something new, different and fresh in both living quarters and working conditions.  There will be a variety of living accommodations in a Victory City and a variety of Victory Cities themselves.</p>

<p>The age of the Victory City will be the perfect companion to the space age, the electronic age, the atomic age, the age of automation and the age of computers.</p>

<H3><font color="#004685"><font color="#004685">Population and City Structure</font></font></H3>

<p>Victory Cities will create a higher standard of living for people, but will require less natural resources, money and energy to achieve it.</p>

<p>One basic unit for a Victory City will house 47,500 people, and a typical Victory City could be built with any multiple of units. The plans presented here are for a Victory City of seven units and 332,000 people.</p>

<H3><font color="#004685"><font color="#004685">Why Victory Cities Are Needed</font></font></H3>

<p>Our present-day cities are obsolete because they are unable to meet the problems of:</p>

<UL>
<LI type="square">growth of slums<br>
<LI type="square">traffic congestion<br>
<LI type="square">air pollution<br>
<LI type="square">noise<br>
<LI type="square">economic waste<br>
<LI type="square">poorly coordinated municipal planning due to division of political authority<br>
</UL>

<p>Economic waste is by far the biggest problem since it includes or is related to all the other problems of our present-day cities.  Victory City plans solve all these problems.</p>

<p>Modern-day cities, with numerous miniature buildings scattered around at random over vast areas of the countryside, will become relics of the past.  Today, these miniature buildings are all connected up by a vast complicated network of transportation, tangled up in knots, called intersections.  Most of these cause traffic delays resulting in congestion or, in short, transportation constipation.</p>

<p>The mammoth waste and inefficiency of these old obsolete cities will be replaced by the new efficient, beautiful but practical, cities of the future, Victory Cities.</p>

<H3><font color="#004685"><font color="#004685">How Victory Cities Will Be Different</font></font></H3>

<p>Urban renewal is at best a semi-socialistic patchwork system, costing more than it is worth, and only temporarily helping to keep our present-day, obsolete cities alive.  When Victory Cities are built in the near future, our present-day, obsolete cities soon will become living museums.</p>

<p>Victory Cities will in no way be connected with, be a part of, or be located in any present-day city.  A Victory City will be built from scratch in the countryside and will stand alone.  All surrounding countryside will be owned and operated by the Victory City Corporation, a company comprised of corporate investors.  No other buildings will be built in the area.  A Victory City will build, sustain, and operate all highways leading to and circling the city.</p>

<p>There is at the present time no building, no city, and no project of any kind, anywhere in the world that in any substantial way bears any resemblance to the plans for Victory Cities.</p>

<p>Victory Cities will receive no tax support from any government, as do present-day, obsolete cities.</p>

<H3><font color="#004685"><font color="#004685">Convenience and Comfort Are Key</font></font></H3>

<p>In contrast to present-day cities' transportation constipation, Victory Cities will have 100% free-flowing traffic and scenic beauty.  There will be no old-fashioned stop signs and traffic lights.  In the super-highway system, there will be only ramps and cloverleaf-type intersections to facilitate free-flow traffic 24 hours a day without exception.  The highways will converge on a Victory City like the spokes of a wheel, and will also be connected by gracefully curved ramps to the circular highway which, in turn, connects with all the other highways.</p>

<p>If a traveler on a Victory City highway was not actually going to Victory City, but some city beyond, he wouldn't need to go through Victory City at all.  He could simply bypass it by taking the circular highway.  Try this some time with any one of the old-fashioned obsolete cities.</p>

<p>A Victory City will be built of reinforced poured concrete.  It will have metal doors, metal door frames and metal windows.  The outside will be finished in a glass curtain wall covering most areas.  The entire building will be both fireproof and soundproof.  It will have central heating and air conditioning throughout.</p>

<p>Even in the most severe winter weather, when the snow is knee-deep and the temperature is below zero, or when it is pouring down rain, you could go anywhere in Victory City without any delay or discomfort or inconvenience.</p>

<p>Gone would be the days of shoveling snow just to get the car out of the garage; of shoveling snow off porches, steps and sidewalks; of slipping around on icy streets; of flu and pneumonia due to being caught in the rain; of heavy overcoats to tug around; of hats, gloves, umbrellas, overshoes and boots; of dangerous streets for school children to cross.</p>

<H3><font color="#004685"><font color="#004685">The Possibilities Are Endless</font></font></H3>

<p>When something new is created to solve old problems, there are always new problems created.  When a Victory City is finally created, the chief new problem will arise out of the fact that so many old problems will have been solved that people will have an extra large surplus of time and money and they will have to find something to do with both.  Of course, we will take this into consideration in the planning of Victory City.  Some of the areas that could be expanded from what you see on this website include:  education, science, culture, recreation, sports, and travel.  It might even be possible for many Victory City residents to use their extra time and money to unleash their latent inventive genius.  This development will tend to work for the benefit of everyone else as well.</p>
